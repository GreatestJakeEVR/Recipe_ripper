He said his father had cut his hair because he\\ncould not afford the 25 cents for a barber to do it. I sent a\\nnote to his parents asking them if it was all right for me to\\npay for his hair cut.\\n\\n\"The next day he met me at the bus with a great grin\\nand stuck to me like glue. Finally I asked why he would\\nnot go to play. He said his father said he could have his\\nhair cut, if I went with him, because he had never been to\\ntown in his life. We went. He got his haircut and\\ngraduated from school. I have never forgotten that child.\\n\\n\"I taught for 37 years. I loved the children and the\\nteaching.
