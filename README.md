# Recipe_ripper

This is a Python project that I'm using to grab recipes from scans of an old cookbook.
By the end of September 2023 they should be available at cookbook.jakeardoin.com

Until then feel free to dig through the recipe_df.pkl dataframe for the ones I have done.
Or try your luck with the raw OCR text in text_df and hope the ingredient amounts are correct.
