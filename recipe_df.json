It's somewhere in between soup and stew. It's not thick like a stew, but it's not thin like a soup. It's a little thicker than a soup.|\n|Jake: If it's too thin, you can add more roux. If it's too thick, you can add more water. You should add the roux as described below to keep clumps of it from sticking to the ingredients in the pot|\n|Jake: Roux likes to stick to stuff. You can avoid this by mixing the roux and water before you add anything else. Or, if you need to add roux later, you do this: add roux and some water in a seperate bowl. Microwave until water is hot then mash the roux with a spoon and mix until it blends with water. Keep on microwaving it if you are having trouble getting it to mix. Then pour the water into the gumbo to add the roux. The excess water can be boiled off until its the right consitency.|\n\n",
